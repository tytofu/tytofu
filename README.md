I'm a software developer passionate about creating efficient and robust solutions. My technical stack includes C, C++, Assembly, and Zig. I enjoy diving deep into system-level programming and exploring the intricacies of compilers and operating systems.

- 🔭 Currently working on enhancing my skills in low-level programming and algorithms.
- 🌱 Learning new technologies and methodologies to stay updated in the ever-evolving tech world.
- 💻 Open to collaboration on interesting projects and contributing to open-source communities.

### Hobbies & Interests
